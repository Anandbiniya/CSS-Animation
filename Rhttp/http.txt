What are Hooks?
ans:hooks are a new feature adition in React version 16.8 which allow you to use React features with out having to write a class
Hooks does not work inside the classes


Why Hooks?
ans:
Reason Set 1:
Understand how this key word works in Java script
Rememeber to bind event handlers in class components
Classes dont monify very well and make hot reloading very unreliablle


Reason set2
There is no particular way to use stateful component logic
HOC and render props patterns do address this problem
Makes the code harder to follow
There is need to share state ful logic in a better way

Reason Set3
Create components for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing events
Related code is  not organized in one place
Ex-Data Fetching:In componentDidMount and componentDid update
ex:EventListners:In componentDidMount and ComponenetWillUnmount
Because of stateful logic:Cannot break components into smaller ones
