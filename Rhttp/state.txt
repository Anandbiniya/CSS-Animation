what is useState?
ans:useState is a hook that lets add react state to functional components


Rules of Hooks
Only calls Hooks at the top level
Only call hooks from react function


UseState with previous state

A state variable can be a number,string boolean object array
use state does not automatically merge and update the objects


In classes state is always object
with in the useState hook the state does not have to be an object
use State hook returns an array with two elements
The first element is the current value of the state and the second element is a state setter function
If New state value depends on previous state value you can pass function to the setter function
when you are dealing with objects or array always make sure to spread your state variable and then call setter function
