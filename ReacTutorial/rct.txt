Props
ypes of using props in react

There are a few different ways that you can use props in a React component. Here are a few examples:

Pass a single prop: You can pass a single prop to a component by specifying the prop as an attribute of the component. For example:

<Greeting name="Anand" />

Pass multiple props: You can pass multiple props to a component by specifying them as attributes of the component. For example:

<Greeting name="Anand" age={32} />
Pass children: You can pass children to a component by including them between the opening and closing tags of the component. For example:

<Greeting>Hello, Anand!</Greeting>
Pass a function as a prop: You can pass a function as a prop to a component by specifying it as an attribute of the component. For example:

<Greeting onClick={() => console.log('Hello, Anand!')} />


In React, props are a way for a parent component to pass data to a child component. Props are read-only in the child component, which means the child component cannot modify the props it receives.

Here are a few rules to follow when using props in a React component:

Always start props with a lowercase letter. React treats components starting with uppercase letters as a different type of component, such as a custom component, and will throw an error.

Do not modify the props inside the component. Props should be treated as read-only, and any attempt to modify them will result in an error. If you need to modify the data, consider using the state instead.

Make sure to pass all required props. If a component is expecting certain props and they are not provided, it will throw an error.

Use default props to specify fallback values for props that are not required. This can help prevent errors if a prop is not provided.

Use prop types to specify the type of a prop. This can help catch mistakes during development and provide documentation for the component.

Avoid using props for state. Props are meant to be passed from a parent component, and the child component should not modify them. If you need to modify data within a component, consider using the state instead.



How to get value from child component to parent component in React?

To pass data from child to parent component in React:
Pass a function as a prop to the Child component.
Call the function in the Child component and pass the data as arguments.
Access the data in the function in the Parent .
