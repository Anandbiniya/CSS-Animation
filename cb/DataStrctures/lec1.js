//what is an algorithm
//ans:Algorithm is an set of well defined instruction to solve particular problem

//an algorithm to add two numbers
//ingredients:input(Two numbers a and b)
//Receipe:algorith(Add numbers using "+") and return the value
//Dish:out put:sum of 'a' and 'b'


//characterstics
//should have well defined input and out puts
//Each step should be clear and unambiguous
//Language independent

//Why ALgorithms
// As a developer we are going to come across problems that we need to solve
// Learng algorithms translates to learng different techniquies to efficiency solve those problems
//one problem can be solved by many ways



// Algorith analysis
// The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted,since it depends on a number of factors.
// Programming language used to implement the algorith
// other programme running at the same time
// Quality of the operating system

//we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its size
//evaluation of algorith is two time
// Time complexity:Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run,as a function of input size.
//Space complexity:Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run,as a function of input size.

//By evaluating against the input size ,the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more approprite



// How to be represent complexity
// Asymptotic nottation
//Big-O notation:worst case complexity(O-notation)
//Omega notation:Best case complexity()
//Theta Notation:for Average case complexity
